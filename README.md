# KnowBe4
KnowBe4 API Example

I forked this project from another repo which appears to no longer exist. I was planning on expanding it to use for batched reports and possibly to randomly pick users that correctly reported their phishing test for a reward. For now, it is just an example of how to use the KnowBe4 API.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MrAlexFranco">MrAlexFranco</a> for creating this script. All credit goes to him at this point.
